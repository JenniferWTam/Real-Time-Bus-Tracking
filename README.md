# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking
## Description
### Working with the DOM in JavaScript to Add Animation To Maps
<img src= "Map.png" width='300'/>
We used the MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard & MIT, adding animated markers on the map to highlight bus routes.

## Steps to Run
Ensure you have the following files downloaded from this repository onto your local machine.
<ul>
  <li>index.html</li>
  <li>mapanimation.je</li>
  <li>styles.css</li>
</ul>
Drag and drop the index.html into your web browser

## Future Improvements
I would like to display the estimated arrival time of the busses to the subsequent stops.
